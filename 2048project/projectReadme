2048 Project Synopsis 
CSC 172 Lab Section MW 325-440
10/10/18

In this project, I created a board with integers with an 80% chance of showing 2 and a
20% chance of showing a 4. I implemented multiple methods to try and move the integers
within the 4x4 gameboard. The methods I used were made to print borders, shift integers left
and right, moving the integers up or down, combining integers left or right, and using keys
to ask the player whether or not they want to quit the game. I also had to implement a reset
button that allows the player to restart their game. I made two classes, one for the board and
one for the controller that the player will input their keys. One thing to note, my moving 
left method for some reason moves my integers to the right. *The only method that works
properly is my combining and moving down integers. Gal and Liza, I tried my best to fix
these issues by myself and could not in the end. I've been freaking out over this and tried
to get help with the issues but was busy with all my calculus and discrete midterms. I'm
sorry that this is not complete and has errors, as I did try my best. I'm still struggling 
to keep up with 172 as I technically completed the 171 equivalent course in my old
university which covered half of the 171 course in UofR.
