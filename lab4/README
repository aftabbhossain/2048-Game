Lab 2 (Java Generics) Synopsis 
CSC 172 Lab Section MW 325-440
10/19/18

Lab 4 required us to make DNA strings by implementing linked lists within
the code. I have 4 classes to divide up the work. The first class is for the
list itself. The list class is in charge of moving the elements from their current
positions to the previous one, moving elements to the head or tail, appending, 
and inserting. The link class is where I implemented the methods for the setters 
and getters. The Biol class is where I implemented the methods in charge of
inserting, removing, printing, clipping, copying, and transcribing the positions.
**This lab was really confusing for me because I found the directions to be very
vague. I really tried my best to try and complete the lab but could not do so :'(.
