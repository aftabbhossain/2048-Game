Lab 3 (Array, ArrayLists, Iterations) Synopsis 
CSC 172 Lab Section MW 325-440
09/29/18

Lab 3 required us to complete 3 tasks. The first task required us to utilize 
arrays and implementing print2Darray function in order to output the integers
within the array in columns and rows. In order to keep the format of show casing
the integers within the array in line with each other, I implemented spaces after 
any integer less than 10. By doing this, the single digit integers became in line 
with the double digit integers, thus forming the column and row formation. Task 2
required us to implement the runningSum2DArray and what that function essentially did
was take the array from task 1 and then take the sum of the two integers and lay the 
sum within the array. The new array contained overall larger integers. We also 
implemented the function print2DList which essentially listed out the new array within
the output. Finally, task 3 required us to iterate the ArrayList in 4 different ways. 
The 4 ways included while/for loops, enhanced for loops, for loops with iterators, and
the while loop with iterators. 

The src code are divided into three sections each containing the separate tasks of lab3.
